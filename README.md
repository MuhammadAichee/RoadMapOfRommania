# Shortest Path problem
We have given a roadmap of Rommania, Out task is find to shortest dstance between any user defined source and destination.

Above problem is solved through following algorithms:
    1) Uniform Cost Search
    2) Greedy Best First Search
    3) Iterative Deepning depth first search.
    4) Breadth First search

Steps:
    1) clone the project.
    2) run command "pipenv install".
    3) run command "pipenv shell"
    4) run command "python main.py"
    5) Type source and destination name from the map in file graph.jpg.
